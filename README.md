# Kerbal Joint Reinforcement /L (Archive)

Physics stabilizer plugin for Kerbal Space Program. Fork by Lisias.


## In a Hurry

This is kind of "Take Over", where I will develop the plugin to meet my own needs. This probably will break the expected behaviour from previous versions. If you need a updated, consistent and stable version for the Ferram4's KJR, I suggest LGG's fork (see below).
